## About the App
Marvel Themed Memory Game app for entry to the *Rviewer Jobathon Frontend Challenge*

The dynamics of the game consist of presenting a board with a series of face-down cards and revealing all the pairs before the time is up. The user will tap on each card to turn it over and, if two of them match when they are uncovered, they will be turned face up. If not, they will be hidden again.

The game is won if all pairs are uncovered within the time limit.

The game will have an initial screen to select one of the three difficulties and 1 minute to solve each board:

- Easy: 4x4 board
- Medium: 4x6 board (or 6x4 depending on the screen)
- Difficult: 5x6 board (or 6x5 depending on screen)

The application has a main game screen that contains the following elements:

- Game board. The board where the user will play and see the cards.
- Move counter. Every time 2 cards are turned over it will increase by 1, whether you hit or not.
- Time counter. A 1-min countdown to reveal all pairs!
